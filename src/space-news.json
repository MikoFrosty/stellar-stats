The supernova, called SN 1987A, was first observed on Feb. 24, 1987, and occurred 160,000 light-years from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was the most recent supernova in the Local Group of galaxies and the first one to have been observable with the naked eye since Kepler’s Supernova in 1604.","publishedAt":"2024-02-25T20:36:09.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-25T20:46:58.035Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22702,"title":"What’s Happening in Space Policy February 25-March 2, 2024","url":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/whats-happening-in-space-policy-february-25-march-2-2024/","imageUrl":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crew-8-webp-file-300x240.webp","newsSite":"SpacePolicyOnline.com","summary":"Here is SpacePolicyOnline.com’s list of space policy events for the week of February 25-March 2, 2024 and any insight we can offer about them.

After Powered Descent Initiation occurred at 5:11 PM CST, Odysseus’s main engine fired for approximately eleven minutes, bringing the vehicle down for a soft landing on the lunar highlands at 5:23 CST. Despite a slight pointing error which delayed acquisition of signal, the lander was confirmed to be on the surface and transmitting a few minutes after touchdown. At a press conference on February 23rd, Intuitive Machines CEO Stephen Altemus reported that the team currently believes the lander to be lying on its side, but otherwise intact. Odysseus is the first American spacecraft to have safely landed on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, and the first to do so near the lunar South Pole.","publishedAt":"2024-02-23T21:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-24T07:43:08.462Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"942a1814-c237-41de-9970-d27bb9630f3b","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[{"id":915,"provider":"Launch Library 2"}]}]
