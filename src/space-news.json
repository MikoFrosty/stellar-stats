When black holes consume planets, stars, and other cosmic objects, the matter from the collision between the two objects gets violently thrown around space — creating streams of particles traveling near the speed of light from black holes. These streams of particles are known as jets, and while scientists know that these jets can accelerate particles, known as cosmic rays, they know very little about the exact process by which the particles are accelerated.","publishedAt":"2024-01-24T19:24:28.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-24T19:29:07.413Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22207,"title":"Europe weeks away from finalizing
