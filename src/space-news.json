Over a decade after Spitzer’s results were published, the joint NASA, European Space Agency, and Canadian Space Agency James Webb Space Telescope observed SZ Cha and directly detected distinct amounts of neon in the protoplanetary disk of SZ Cha — confirming Spitzer’s observations from 2008.","publishedAt":"2023-11-19T22:14:07.000Z","updatedAt":"2023-11-19T22:19:24.480Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":21562,"title":"What’s Happening in Space Policy November 19-December 2, 2023","url":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/whats-happening-in-space-policy-november-19-december-2-2023/","imageUrl":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Wayne-Hale-SAS-200x300.jpg","newsSite":"SpacePolicyOnline.com","summary":"Here is SpacePolicyOnline.com’s list of space policy events for the next TWO weeks, November 19-December 2, 2023 and any insight we can offer about them.
