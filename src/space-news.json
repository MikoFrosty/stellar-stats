After Powered Descent Initiation occurred at 5:11 PM CST, Odysseus’s main engine fired for approximately eleven minutes, bringing the vehicle down for a soft landing on the lunar highlands at 5:23 CST. Despite a slight pointing error which delayed acquisition of signal, the lander was confirmed to be on the surface and transmitting a few minutes after touchdown. At a press conference on February 23rd, Intuitive Machines CEO Stephen Altemus reported that the team currently believes the lander to be lying on its side, but otherwise intact. Odysseus is the first American spacecraft to have safely landed on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, and the first to do so near the lunar South Pole.","publishedAt":"2024-02-23T21:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-24T07:43:08.462Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"942a1814-c237-41de-9970-d27bb9630f3b","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[{"id":915,"provider":"Launch Library 2"}]},{"id":22536,"title":"Webinar Replay: Automating for SmallSat Success","url":"https://spacenews.com/webinar-automating-for-smallsat-success/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sn_wb1_Replay.png","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"The purpose of the webinar was to explore how today’s SmallSat leaders are employing automation in satellite operations and manufacturing.
