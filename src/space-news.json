Despite the tremendous success of Vulcan, the Peregrine lander remains in peril, with the spacecraft encountering an anomaly after separation from the Centaur upper stage.","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T16:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T17:31:59.125Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"b973e965-3901-4bda-9236-b0afee33f388","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22036,"title":"Peregrine lander suffers anomaly after launch","url":"https://spacenews.com/peregrine-lander-suffers-anomaly-after-launch/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Peregrine-photo.jpg","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"Astrobotic said its Peregrine spacecraft suffered an unspecified anomaly hours after launch Jan. 8, putting its plans to land on the moon in jeopardy.","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T15:48:50.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T16:21:57.261Z","featured":true,"launches":[{"id":"b973e965-3901-4bda-9236-b0afee33f388","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22035,"title":"The advent of astropolitical alliances","url":"https://spacenews.com/advent-astropolitical-alliances/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/artemis-accords-graphic-web-112923.png","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"As the Artemis Accords and China's ILRS Initiative grow in signatories, more and more countries may be forced to pick a side.","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T15:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T15:39:16.148Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22034,"title":"ULA’s Vulcan rocket launches as the newest challenger to SpaceX","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/ula-vulcan-rocket-launches-newest-spacex-challenger.html","imageUrl":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107355275-1704714228590-gettyimages-1908859797-AFP_349R768.jpeg","newsSite":"CNBC","summary":"A new U.S. rocket reached orbit early Monday, and the launch was a big one – not just in scale of the vehicle, but also in significance for a market that’s become dominated by a single player in recent years.","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T13:26:10.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T13:35:48.983Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"b973e965-3901-4bda-9236-b0afee33f388","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22033,"title":"Daily Telescope: The Wizard Nebula captured above Germany","url":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/daily-telescope-the-wizard-nebula-captured-above-germany/","imageUrl":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/NGC7380-Amanakis-Ars-Daily-Telescope.jpg","newsSite":"Arstechnica","summary":"The stars in this cluster are estimated to be about 4 to 12 million years old.","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T13:00:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-08T13:09:36.590Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22032,"title":"First U.S. Lunar Lander in More than 50 Years On Its Way","url":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/first-u-s-lunar-lander-in-more-than-50-years-on-its-way/","imageUrl":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Peregrine-trajectory-300x166.png","newsSite":"SpacePolicyOnline.com","summary":"Astrobotic’s Peregrine lunar lander is on its way to the Moon.
