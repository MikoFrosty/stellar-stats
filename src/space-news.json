Officially, SLIM has entered a dormant period, and the intent to attempt continued operations once the sun begins shining on SLIM’s solar cells again has been declared on the official page of the SLIM mission on the site formerly known as Twitter. Details on the precise nature of the difficulties faced during landing and the fruits of its limited operation on the lunar surface have been disclosed in the time since Space Scout’s last report on the mission. While the mission is in its dormant period and the chances of the mission continuing remain unclear, SLIM’s mission has accomplished its goals, and has wide reaching implications for JAXA’s future ambitions at the Moon and beyond.","publishedAt":"2024-02-13T16:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T17:30:09.536Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"2ba0b63c-e5f6-4899-b588-387c7c8e71ca","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22562,"title":"Satellite connectivity startup Skylo hooks backers such as Intel, BMW, Samsung to raise $37 million","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/startup-skylo-raises-37-million-from-intel-bmw-samsung.html","imageUrl":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107372770-1707828652552-Skylo-Base-Station-w_founders.jpg","newsSite":"CNBC","summary":"Silicon Valley space startup Skylo Technologies landed funding from the corporate venture arms of Intel, BMW and Samsung, as the company aims to bridge the gap between satellite and terrestrial communications.","publishedAt":"2024-02-13T15:00:01.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T15:07:45.870Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22561,"title":"K2 Space, a startup with SpaceX veterans building monster satellites, raises $50 million","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/startup-k2-space-raises-50-million.html","imageUrl":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107372518-1707772530663-GU1A1753-4.jpg","newsSite":"CNBC","summary":"Los Angeles-based startup K2 Space raised $50 million in new funding as the company works to build monster satellites to match the massive rockets that are coming to market. ","publishedAt":"2024-02-13T13:00:01.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T13:07:02.839Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22560,"title":"SpaceX to deorbit 100 older Starlink satellites","url":"https://spacenews.com/spacex-to-deorbit-100-older-starlink-satellites/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/starlink-stack.jpg","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"SpaceX plans to remove from orbit about 100 of its older Starlink satellites because of a design flaw that could cause them to fail.","publishedAt":"2024-02-13T12:27:35.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T12:36:20.863Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22559,"title":"Intuitive Machines ready for launch of its first lunar lander","url":"https://spacenews.com/intuitive-machines-ready-for-launch-of-its-first-lunar-lander/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/f9-im1-prelaunch.jpg","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"Intuitive Machines says its first lunar lander is ready for launch this week after completing a final series of tests on the launch pad.","publishedAt":"2024-02-13T11:28:42.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T11:49:10.845Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"942a1814-c237-41de-9970-d27bb9630f3b","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22558,"title":"The Exploration Company Continues Testing its Huracán Rocket Engine","url":"https://europeanspaceflight.com/the-exploration-company-continues-testing-its-huracan-rocket-engine/","imageUrl":"https://europeanspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Exploration-Company-Continues-Testing-Huracan-Rocket-Engine.jpg","newsSite":"European Spaceflight","summary":"Space transportation startup The Exploration Company has continued testing its methane-powered Huracán engine, which will power the company’s Nyx Moon spacecraft.
