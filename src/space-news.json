Notably, IFT-3 successfully achieved the first complete ascent of the combined Starship and Super Heavy system. SpaceX demonstrated several important test objectives during an approximately 40-minute coast phase, but the Starship vehicle was ultimately lost during reentry at the end of the flight. The nominal flight path included only about half of a complete orbit around the Earth; nevertheless, Starship has demonstrated the capability to achieve orbital flight, setting the stage for its test campaign to accelerate in support of its obligations under the Artemis program.","publishedAt":"2024-03-14T22:30:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-15T07:18:17.453Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"c0d90c60-4961-470a-a6d7-804b3bf4b012","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22926,"title":"FCC approves direct-to-smartphone regulatory framework","url":"https://spacenews.com/fcc-approves-direct-to-smartphone-regulatory-framework/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FCC-chair-scaled.jpg","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"U.S. regulators have approved ground rules for allowing SpaceX and other satellite operators to use radio waves from terrestrial mobile partners to keep smartphone users connected outside cell tower coverage.","publishedAt":"2024-03-14T17:26:12.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-14T17:28:49.204Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22925,"title":"Sierra Space developing dual-use spacecraft with military potential","url":"https://spacenews.com/sierra-space-developing-dual-use-spacecraft-with-military-potential/","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sierra-Space-Axelerator-Spectre-LEFT-and-Ghost-RIGHT-scaled.jpg","newsSite":"SpaceNews","summary":"With a $1.3 billion defense backlog, the company is eyeing opportunities for in-orbit services and transportation vehicles","publishedAt":"2024-03-14T17:05:59.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-14T17:08:46.745Z","featured":false,"launches":[],"events":[]},{"id":22924,"title":"SpaceX successful in epic third Starship test launch","url":"https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-successful-in-epic-third-starship-test-launch/","imageUrl":"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GIo7gbLbIAAFmL7-scaled-e1710429135631.jpg","newsSite":"Teslarati","summary":"SpaceX was successful in its third test flight of the largest rocket ever as Starship took to the skies at 8:25 am...","publishedAt":"2024-03-14T15:29:28.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-14T15:33:33.040Z","featured":false,"launches":[{"id":"c0d90c60-4961-470a-a6d7-804b3bf4b012","provider":"Launch Library 2"}],"events":[]},{"id":22923,"title":"SpaceX Scores Many Successes on Third Starship Test Flight","url":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/spacex-scores-many-successes-on-third-starship-test-flight/","imageUrl":"https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/spacex-birthday-2002-300x167.png","newsSite":"SpacePolicyOnline.com","summary":"SpaceX is still collecting and analyzing data from the third Starship test flight, but it is clear it scored many successes.
